# Combinational Circuits

## What is a Combinational Circuit?

It can basically be described as the digital circuits which are not dependent on any kind of past/future data, rather processes the output based on the current combination of the inputs. These create the basics of many complex circuits.

For the upcoming days I'll be uploading the coding of different types of combinational circuits.
